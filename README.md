# MutRose Instructions
This repository contains all of the files needed in order to get instructions for modelling with the MutRoSe framework as well as information on the examples to be modelled in order to answer the form available [here](https://forms.gle/haKsHo6mRKndAAjS7). This form is part of the MutRoSe framework research and answering it will be very helpful for the author to evaluate it!

## Repository Structure
This repository contains two higher level folders:

 - Examples Explanation: This folder contains the PDF with the explanation of the examples to be modelled. It also contains the folder of each one of the examples, which contains all of the models which are already given alongside the binary for the execution of the decomposition
 - Instruction: This folder contains the PDF with detailed instructions of the MutRoSe framework. It also contains the folder for the example used to explain the concepts inside the document

## Goals
After finishing the reading of the documents, you will:

 - Learn how to model the Goal Model and HDDL Domain specification for the MutRoSe framework
 - Learn how to run the decomposition binary and understand its output
 - Implement your own models for two examples
 - Help the MutRoSe framework research! 

## Overview

### Goal Model
The Goal Model in the MutRoSe framework is based on the Contextual Runtime Goal Model (CRGM) proposed in [1]. Its modelling can be performed in the [piStar-GODA](https://pistar-goda.herokuapp.com/) framework.

### HDDL
The HDDL Domain specification uses a subset of the one proposed in [2] with the addition of some structures. Its modelling can be performed using any text editor of your preference.

## Instruction Video
You can find an example-based explanation video [here](TODO).

## Notes
One must note that:

 - The "Room Preparation" example is optional for answering the form. It is highly appreciated if it is modelled since it is a more complex example which helps a lot at evaluating the framework!
